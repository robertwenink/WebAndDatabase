				a user to see some statistics of the game 
				(how many games are currently ongoing, how many users have started a game, etc. 
				- pick three statistics you want to report), 
				- a brief description of how-to-play on your platform and a 
				- Play button (or something to that effect).-->
				You have 12 game pieces. Your goal is to immobilize all pieces of your opponent, which either means all pieces have been captured or the remaining pieces cannot make a move anymore.
				Moving is only done forward and diagonally by one tile over the dark tiles. 
				Capturing can be done by diagonally hopping over an oponent`s piece, however the space behind it must of course be vacant. 
				If one is able to capture, it is obliged. This counts for multiple captures with one piece as well.
				If a piece reaches the last line of the opponent`s side, it is transformed in a King, and can now move and capture backwards as well!
